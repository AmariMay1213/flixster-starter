### Walkthrough Video

`TODO://` Add the embedded URL code to your animated app walkthrough below, `ADD_EMBEDDED_CODE_HERE`. Make sure the video or gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. Ensure your walkthrough showcases the presence and/or functionality of all features you implemented above (check them off as you film!). Pay attention to any **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS** checkboxes listed above to ensure graders see the full functionality of your website!

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I only did labs one and two and I would say that lab one taught me how to do git commands and lab two taught me basic React setup. Lab one I learned the basic commands such as commit and push within the terminal and in doing so I commit more often than I did for the first two projects. Lab two helped me learn how to use React and playing with the language so it helped a lot with the basic set up of this project in order to set up components. I don't think I felt unprepared to complete the weekly assignments I just feel like we don't have enough time to do all the labs and the project in a reasonable amount of time. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

  If I had more time I would have implemented the Sidebar feature, focus on playing with different fonts for the website, and making the search bar larger. I didn't have time for a lot of these in order to meet the due date, hoeever I tried to change the size of my search bar however all of my tries failed. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I believe what went well for my project demo is that I always have strong energy while presenting as I pride myself in a strong voice and body language. After talking to Devarsh I tried a new presentation style of showing off my website first then transitioning to my presentation slides. It went well and I felt very comfortable doing it so I will continue that presentation style. The main thing I will work on from this project is first pacing myself, when I feel like I'm running out of time I often speak extremely fast which I did this presentation, and I even felt a bit nervous for some reason. I think the solution for next time is spending more time practicing ahead of time in front of a crowd as well as not being afraid to take a deep breath while presenting and continuing my presentation in order to calm myself down. I really appreciate how my peers stray away from the demo slides and now make their slides on theme with their website so I think I will try the same thing next time.
